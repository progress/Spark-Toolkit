“Licensed Developers” means one of Your employees or third-party consultants authorized to develop Your Integrated Products specifically for You using the Software in accordance with this Agreement. Licensed Developers must correspond to the maximum number of seats You have purchased from Telerik hereunder. This means that, at any given time, the number of Licensed Developers cannot exceed the number of seats that You have purchased from Telerik and for which You have paid Telerik all applicable License Fees pursuant to this Agreement. The Software is in “use” on a computer when it is loaded into temporary memory (i.e. RAM) or installed into permanent memory (e.g. hard disk or other storage device). Your Licensed Developers may install the Software on multiple machines, so long as the Software is not being used simultaneously for development purposes at any given time by more Licensed Developers than You have seats.

“Your Integrated Products” are limited to those software applications which: (i) are developed by Your Licensed Developers; (ii) add substantial functionality beyond the functionality provided by the incorporated components of the Software; and (iii) are not commercial alternatives for, or competitive in the marketplace with, the Software or any components of the Software.

1. Software License. 

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Telerik hereby grants to You the following limited, non–exclusive, non–transferable license (the “License”) to use the Kendo UI Software (as defined below)  as set forth below. You are granted either a Trial License pursuant to Section 1.1 or a Developer License with Updates and Support pursuant to Section 1.2. Which version of the License applies (i.e., Trial License or Developer License with Updates and Support) is determined at the time of the License purchase.  



1.1 Trial License

1.1.1 License Grant. If You download the free Trial License, then, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, Licensor hereby grants to Licensee and Licensee hereby accepts a license to use the Software for the sole purpose of evaluating its functionality and performance. You are not allowed to integrate the Software into end products or use it for any commercial, productive or training purpose. You may not redistribute the Software. The term of the Trial License shall be 30 days. If You wish to continue using the Software beyond expiration of the Trial License, You must purchase the applicable Developer License.

1.1.2 Support. You are entitled to enter five (5) support requests via Telerik’s ticketing system with a 72 hour response time (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) for thirty (30) days after download of Your initial Trial License.  For avoidance of doubt, You are not entitled to additional support requests for any Trial Licenses downloaded after Your initial download (e.g. to evaluate a different Kendo UI Program or a new release), for a period of one (1) year from the date of Your initial download.

1.1.3 Updates. At Telerik’s sole discretion, You may receive minor updates (i.e., service pack updates) for the Software version You are evaluating. You are not eligible to receive major updates (i.e. major revisions to or new versions of the Software) for the Software You are evaluating. Software updates replace and/or supplement (and may disable) the version of the Software that formed the basis for Your eligibility for the update. You may use the resulting updated Software only in accordance with the terms of this Trial License.

1.1.4 THE TRIAL VERSION OF THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED ‘AS IS’. YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. TELERIK GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS. YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS WHICH THIS AGREEMENT CANNOT CHANGE. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, TELERIK EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

1.2 Developer License with Updates and Support.  

1.2.1 License Grant. If You purchase a Developer License with Updates and Support, Your Licensed Developers may use the Software in minified form, and source code form (if provided) in accordance with Section 1.3, in the development of Your Integrated Products. You may also embed copies of the Kendo UI Programs in Your Integrated Products that You license and distribute to Your own end-user licensees, including but not limited to, Your employees (“Authorized End-Users”) solely in accordance with the requirements set forth in Section 2 below. In addition, for the applicable period for which You have purchased updates and support (the “Subscription Period”), You will receive minor and major updates for the Software, access to certain source code for the Software, as well as the support package to which you have subscribed, each as described in further detail below.

1.2.2 Support. During the Subscription Period, You are entitled to either the “Lite”, “Priority”, or “Ultimate” support package as described in greater detail here: http://www.telerik.com/purchase/support-plans/devtools  subject to the limitations and restrictions described in the following Fair Usage Policy. The support services for tickets submitted relating to AngularJS implementations are limited to (i) assistance with plain implementations which include AngularJS and Progress Kendo UI widgets, (ii) assistance with implementations which utilize the Kendo Angular labs project (https://github.com/kendo-labs/angular-kendo) and its directives (project support) or (iii) implementations which require extension of the existing Kendo Angular labs project with new logic. You will lose the right to receive support and updates at the end of your Subscription Period, unless you renew your access to updates and support for additional Subscription Period(s) with Telerik at additional cost. Your level of support (Lite, Priority or Ultimate) is determined at the time of initial license purchase. You may upgrade Your level of support at any time during an active Subscription Period provided Telerik continues to make such levels of support generally available. Any support level upgrades (if purchased) and all access to support and updates thereunder will be bound to the term of the then active Subscription Period (i.e. the renewal/expiration date of Your Subscription Period will not change as a result of the support level upgrade). You generally may not downgrade Your level of support and there is no automated mechanism available to You by which to downgrade.

1.2.2.1 Support Package Fair Usage Policy. Telerik may limit or terminate Your access to any or all of the support services if Your use of the support services is determined by Telerik, in its sole and reasonable discretion, to be excessive.

1.2.2.2 In no event will Telerik provide support of any kind to end-users of Your Integrated Products.

1.2.3 Updates. During the Subscription Period, You will be eligible to receive all major updates and minor updates for the version of the Software that You license hereunder and source code for the Software. Updates replace and/or supplement (and may disable) the version of the Software that formed the basis for Your eligibility for the update. You may use the resulting updated Software only in accordance with the terms of this License.

1.2.4 Support and Maintenance Auto Renewal Program
  
1.2.4.1 You may elect to enroll in the Support and Maintenance Auto Renewal Program at the time of purchase for a license purchased online at www.telerik.com or at any time thereafter by enabling auto renew within Your www.telerik.com account (“Your Account”) and/or by contacting Telerik directly. By enrolling in the Support and Maintenance Auto Renewal Program, you understand and agree that Your access to updates and support will automatically renew for subsequent one-year Subscription Periods for the entire time that You remain actively enrolled in the Support and Maintenance Auto Renewal Program.

1.2.4.2 As a condition of Your initial and continued enrollment in the Support and Maintenance Auto Renewal Program, You agree to keep Your credit card, billing, and contact information up-to-date at all times via Your Account. You may change Your auto renewal preference at any time within Your Account or by contacting Telerik directly. Telerik may switch Your auto renewal preference to “off” at any time Telerik determines or suspects that Your credit card, billing, and/or contact information is out of date, inaccurate, or fraudulent. Telerik may disable or discontinue the Auto Renewal Program at any time for any reason without providing advance notice to You.

1.2.4.3 Access to updates and support is sold and invoiced by Telerik’s authorized distributor, Telerik Inc. ONCE YOU HAVE ENROLLED IN THE SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE AUTO RENEWAL PROGRAM, UNLESS YOU SET THE SUBSCRIPTION AUTO RENEWAL PREFERENCE TO “OFF” IN YOUR ACCOUNT PRIOR TO THE END OF YOUR EXISTING SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD, YOUR ACCESS TO UPDATES AND SUPPORT WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW, AND YOU AUTHORIZE TELERIK INC. (WITHOUT NOTICE) TO COLLECT THE THEN-APPLICABLE FEE AND ANY TAXES FOR THE RENEWAL SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD, USING THE CREDIT CARD OR BILLING CREDENTIALS THAT YOU PROVIDED WITH RESPECT TO YOUR INITIAL PURCHASE AND/OR YOUR ENROLLMENT IN THE SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE AUTO RENEWAL PROGRAM. 

1.2.4.4 All payments are non-refundable, even if You / Your Licensed Developers stop using the Software and/or stop using/accessing support and updates. The fees and features applicable to support and updates may change over time. Your access will be renewed at an annual fee of 50% of the retail cost of a new Software license (at time of renewal), and at the level Telerik, in its sole discretion, identifies as being closest to that which was provided during Your previous Subscription Period.

1.3 Source Code. Any Software source code that is provided to You by Telerik hereunder, is provided so that You can create modifications under the terms of this Agreement.

1.3.1 While Telerik does not claim any ownership rights in Your Integrated Products, any modifications You develop to the Software source code will be the exclusive property of Telerik, and You agree to and hereby do assign all right, title and interest in and to such modifications and all rights associated therewith to Telerik.

1.3.2 You will be entitled to use modifications of the Software’s source code developed by You under the terms of this Agreement and Telerik hereby grants You a license to use such modifications pursuant to Section 1.2.

1.3.3 You acknowledge that the Software’s source code is confidential and contains valuable and proprietary trade secrets of Telerik. Under no circumstances may any portion of the Software’s source code or any modified version of the source code be distributed, disclosed or otherwise made available to any third party.

1.3.4 Telerik DOES NOT provide technical support for any source code that has been modified by any party other than Telerik.

1.3.5 The Software’s source code is provided “as is”, without warranty of any kind. Refunds are not available for any licenses that include a right to receive source code.

1.4 Testing and Building License. You may also use the Software in the testing and building of Your Integrated Products. This license is not limited to a number of seats.

2. Redistribution under Developer License. If You have purchased a Developer License, You may distribute the Kendo UI Programs in minified form as embedded in Your Integrated Products to Your Authorized End-Users only pursuant to an end-user license that meets the requirements of this Section. You are not permitted to distribute the Software pursuant to this Section: as a standalone product, or as a part of any product other than Your Integrated Product, or in any form that allows it to be reused by any application other than Your Integrated Product. For avoidance of doubt, Your Authorized End Users are not permitted to use the Software, or any portions thereof, for software development or application development purposes unless they also purchase a separate Developer license from Telerik for each of the users. Your end-user license agreement must: impose the limitations set forth in this Section on Your Authorized End Users; prohibit distribution of the Software by Your Authorized End-Users; limit the liability of Your licensors or suppliers to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law; and prohibit any attempt to disassemble, decompile or “unlock”, decode or otherwise reverse translate or engineer, or attempt in any manner to reconstruct or discover any source code or underlying algorithms of the Software, except to the limited extent as is permitted by law notwithstanding contractual prohibition. Provided Your end-user license complies with the requirements of this Section and Your Authorized End-Users are in compliance with such end-user license agreements, any sublicenses to use the Kendo UI Programs granted by You to Your Authorized End-Users will survive any termination of this Agreement or the License set forth herein between You and Telerik. You are not allowed to, and are expressly prohibited from granting Your Authorized End-Users any right to further sublicense the Software. You must include a valid copyright message in Your Integrated Products in a location viewable by Authorized End-Users that will serve to protect Telerik’s copyright and other intellectual property rights in the Software.

3. No Trademark License

You may not use the Telerik product names, logos or trademarks to market Your Integrated Product.

4. Delivery

Telerik shall make a master copy of the Software available for download by Licensee in electronic files only.

5. Updates

The parties agree and acknowledge that updates provided to You as part of this Agreement may include new software products governed by additional terms and conditions. These additional terms and conditions must be accepted by You at the time You download such new products.  If You do not agree to these additional terms and conditions, You should not download the new products. In case of a conflict between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions applicable to any new product made available to You as part of any updates, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall govern.

6. Term and Termination

This Agreement and the Developer License granted hereunder shall continue until terminated in accordance with this Section. Unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, the Developer License granted hereunder shall last as long as You use the Software in compliance with the terms herein. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, and without prejudice to Telerik’s other rights or remedies, Telerik shall have the right to terminate this Agreement and the License granted hereunder immediately if You breach any of the material terms of this Agreement, and You fail to cure such material breach within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice from Telerik.  Upon termination of this Agreement, all Licenses granted to You hereunder shall terminate automatically and You shall immediately cease use and distribution of the Software; provided, however, that any sublicenses granted to Your Authorized End-Users in accordance with Section 2 shall survive such termination. You must also destroy (i) all copies of the Software not integrated into a live, functioning instance(s) of Your Integrated Product(s) already installed, implemented and deployed for Your Authorized End-User(s), and (ii) any product and company logos provided by Telerik in connection with this Agreement.

7. Product Discontinuance

Telerik reserves the right to discontinue the Software or any component of the Software, whether offered as a standalone product or solely as a component, at any time.

8. Intellectual Property

All title and ownership rights in and to the Software (including, but not limited to any images, photographs, animations, video, audio, music, or text embedded in the Software), the intellectual property embodied in the Software, and any trademarks or service marks of Telerik that are used in connection with the Software are and shall at all times remain exclusively owned by Telerik and its licensors. All title and intellectual property rights in and to the content that may be accessed through use of the Software is the property of the respective content owner and may be protected by applicable copyright or other intellectual property laws and treaties. This Agreement grants You no rights to use such content. Any open source software that may be delivered by Telerik embedded in or in association with Telerik products is provided pursuant to the open source license applicable to the software and subject to the disclaimers and limitations on liability set forth in such license. 

9. Limited Warranty

Except with respect to the Trial License, Telerik warrants solely to You that the Software will perform substantially in accordance with the accompanying written materials for a period of ninety (90) days after the date on which You purchase the License for the Software. Telerik does not warrant the use of the Software will be uninterrupted or error free at all times and in all circumstances, nor that program errors will be corrected. This limited warranty shall not apply to any error or failure resulting from (i) machine error, (ii) Your failure to follow operating instructions, (iii) negligence or accident, or (iv) modifications to the Software by any person or entity other than Telerik. In the event of a breach of warranty, Your sole and exclusive remedy and Telerik’s sole and exclusive obligation, is repair of all or any portion of the Software. If such remedy fails of its essential purpose, Licensee’s sole remedy and Telerik’s maximum liability shall be a refund of the paid purchase price for the defective Software only. This limited warranty is only valid if Telerik receives written notice of breach of warranty no later than thirty (30) days after the warranty period expires. EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 9, TELERIK DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

10. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will Telerik be liable for any indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages arising out of the use of or inability to use the Software, including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if advised of the possibility thereof, and regardless of the legal or equitable theory (contract, tort or otherwise) upon which the claim is based. In any case, Telerik’s entire liability under any provision of this Agreement shall not exceed in the aggregate the sum of the license fees Licensee paid to Telerik for the Software giving rise to such damages, notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose of any limited remedy. Telerik’s entire liability under this Agreement related to the Trial License shall not exceed $5, notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose of any limited remedy.  Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not be applicable. Telerik is not responsible for any liability arising out of content provided by Licensee or a third party that is accessed through the Software and/or any material linked through such content. Any data included in the Software upon shipment from Telerik is for testing use only and Telerik hereby disclaims any and all liability arising therefrom.

11. Indemnity

You agree to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend Telerik and its resellers from and against any and all claims, lawsuits and proceedings (collectively “Claims”), and all expenses, costs (including attorney's fees), judgments, damages and other liabilities resulting from such Claims, that arise or result from (i) Your use of the Software in violation of this Agreement, (ii) the use or distribution of Your Integrated Product or (iii) Your modification of the Software’s source code.

12. Confidentiality

Except as otherwise provided herein, each party expressly undertakes to retain in confidence all information and know-how transmitted or disclosed to the other that the disclosing party has identified as being proprietary and/or confidential or that, by the nature of the circumstances surrounding the disclosure, ought in good faith to be treated as proprietary and/or confidential, and expressly undertakes to make no use of such information and know-how except under the terms and during the existence of this Agreement. However, neither party shall have an obligation to maintain the confidentiality of information that (i) it received rightfully from a third party without an obligation to maintain such information in confidence; (ii) the disclosing party has disclosed to a third party without any obligation to maintain such information in confidence; (iii) was known to the receiving party prior to its disclosure by the disclosing party; or (iv) is independently developed by the receiving party without use of the confidential information of the disclosing party. Further, either party may disclose confidential information of the other party as required by governmental or judicial order, provided such party gives the other party prompt written notice prior to such disclosure and complies with any protective order (or equivalent) imposed on such disclosure. Without limiting the foregoing, Licensee shall treat any source code for the Programs as confidential information and shall not disclose, disseminate or distribute such materials to any third party without Telerik’s prior written permission. Each party’s obligations under this Section 12 shall apply at all times during the term of this Agreement and for five (5) years following termination of this Agreement, provided, however, that (i) obligations with respect to source code shall survive in perpetuity and (ii) trade secrets shall be maintained as such until they fall into the public domain.

13. Governing Law

This Agreement will be governed by the law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, U.S.A., without regard to the conflict of laws principles thereof. If any dispute, controversy, or claim cannot be resolved by a good faith discussion between the parties, then it shall be submitted for resolution to a state or Federal court of competent jurisdiction in Boston, Massachusetts, USA, and the parties hereby agree to submit to the jurisdiction and venue of such court. Neither the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act nor the United Nations Convention for the International Sale of Goods shall apply to this Agreement. Failure of a party to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not constitute or be construed as a waiver of such provision or of the right to enforce such provision.

You agree that You are not relying on any representation or obligation other than those set forth in this Agreement.

In cases where this license is being obtained through an approved third party, these terms shall supersede any third party license or purchase agreement.

15. No Assignment

You may not assign, sublicense, sub-contract, or otherwise transfer this Agreement, or any rights or obligations under it, without Telerik’s prior written consent.

16. Survival

Any provisions of the Agreement containing license restrictions, including, but not limited to those related to the Program source code, warranties and warranty disclaimers, confidentiality obligations, limitations of liability and/or indemnity terms, and any provision of the Agreement which, by its nature, is intended to survive shall remain in effect following any termination or expiration of the Agreement.

17. Severability

If a particular provision of this Agreement is terminated or held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining provisions.

18. Force Majeure

Neither party shall be deemed in default of this Agreement if failure or delay in performance is caused by an act of God, fire, flood, severe weather conditions, material shortage or unavailability of transportation, government ordinance, laws, regulations or restrictions, war or civil disorder, or any other cause beyond the reasonable control of such party.
