This README describes contents of the parent folder "rest". The contents
of parent "rest" folder is used by the runtime to initialize REST transport
for the oeabl service. The layout of the rest folder containing a deployed
service e.g. <Service1>.paar will look like:

/rest
|
---- <Service1>
|    |
|    ---- <Service1>.paar
|    |
|    ---- stagingDir
|         |
|         ---- Service1.restoe
|         |
|         ---- mapping.xml
|         |
|         ---- resourceModel.xml
|         |
|         ---- spring.xml
|
---- <Service2>
|    .
|    .
|    .
---- runtime.props

Each new deployed service will have the same layout as explained for Service1 here.

1) <Service1> - Directory
   For each Service (as represented by .paar), new directory is created. The name
   of the directory bears the name of the Service. This directory contains the 
   (.paar) and another directory named "stagingDir" which is the inflated version
   of the (.paar).The "stagingDir" is created when web application context is initialized
   during Tomcat startup. This directory is deleted when the web application context
   is destroyed during the Tomcat shutdown.

2) stagingDir/<Service1>.paar [Progress Archive]
   Archive file containing all the files required to create the REST service endpoint.
   Used by REST runtime to create and manage endpoints. DO NOT DELETE.

3) stagingDir/<Service1>.restoe
   This file contains metadata for the AppServer procedure and the Input/Output params. 
   EDIT NOT RECOMMENDED.

4) stagingDir/mapping.xml
   This file contains information regarding the mapping of Input/Output Parameters
   of the Appserver procedure with the HTTP Request/Response parameters respectively.
   EDIT NOT RECOMMENDED.

5) stagingDir/resourceModel.xml
   This file contains information regarding the mapping of AppServer procedure with 
   the HTTP Verb and HTTP Path.
   EDIT NOT RECOMMENDED.

6) stagingDir/spring.xml
   This file serves as seed of all the adapter functionality. The REST adapter runtime
   uses this file to load all the mappings and procedure metadata. 
   EDIT NOT RECOMMENDED.

7) runtime.props
   Property file containing default values of runtime properties.
   Each deployed SOAP service will inherit property values for its own copy 
   of runtime properties from this file.


Deploying a PAAR (Progress Archive) in an OEABL Application for PAS Server. 
===========================================================================

The PAAR maps the Progress 4GL procedures that run on the Application Server.
Deployment of PAAR can be performed using:

1) deployREST.sh/deployREST.bat utility:
   
   - The utility reside in the PAS instance's bin folder i.e. {CATALINA_BASE}/bin.
   
   - General syntax to deploy a paar is:
     Examples:
       Deploy test.paar to OEABL WebApp named ROOT
       # $CATALINA_BASE/bin/deployREST.sh /tmp/test.paar ROOT

       Undeploy an existing REST service named test from OEABL WebApp ROOT
       # $CATALINA_BASE/bin/deployREST.sh test ROOT -undeploy
   
   - Deployment requires a webapp context reload / server restart. To limit
     production downtime, deploy all the required REST services first and then
     performing Server restart.
   
   - Once deployed, a new folder is created in
     $CATALINA_BASE/webapps/<OEABL WebApp>/WEB-INF/adapters/rest/<ServiceName>.
     After the server restart, and successful load of the service by the runtime
     [.xml, .restoe ] are created inside the stagingDir.
     

2) REST webservice call to oemanager webapp:

   - oemanager webapp serves as a central utility to manage OEABL webapps.

   - General syntax to deploy a paar is:
     Examples:
       Deploy test.paar to OEABL WebApp named ROOT
        # curl -X POST --data-binary @test.paar
        # http://<PASHostName>:<PASPortNum>/oemanager/applications/<InstanceName>/webapps/ROOT/transports/rest/oeservices
        # -H "Accept: application/vnd.progress+json" 
        # -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.progress.paar+xml" 
        # -H "Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=test.paar" -v 

       Undeploy an existing REST service named test from OEABL WebApp ROOT
        # curl -X DELETE
        # http://<PASHostName>:<PASPortNum>/oemanager/applications/<InstanceName>/webapps/ROOT/transports/rest/oeservices/test
   
    - Once deployed, a new folder is created in
      $CATALINA_BASE/webapps/<OEABL WebApp>/WEB-INF/adapters/rest/<ServiceName>.
      After the server restart, and successful load of the service by the runtime
      [.xml, .restoe ] are created inside the stagingDir.

    - oemanager automatically loads all the new definitions by performing 
      a reload of the WebpApp by start/stop of the WebApp context.
